openmrs-module-emr
==================

**If you aren't working with Partners In Health, this is not the module you want to be looking at, but you probably want the module at https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-emrapi, which is part of the OpenMRS Reference Application**

This module was originally written to add higher-level functionality, for a real-time, point-of-care EMR system, built on top of the OpenMRS platform, when building the Mirebalais EMR.

Today, most generic functionality has been moved to OpenMRS's EMRAPI module. The EMR module that this README file belongs to now only includes some PIH-specific functionality that hasn't been generalized and pulled into the Reference Application.
